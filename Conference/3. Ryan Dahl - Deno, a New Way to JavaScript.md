## What is Deno

- Always call **Deno**, `/Dino/`.
- **Deno** is a new command-line runtime for executing **JavaScript** and **TypeScript**.
- **Deno** built using **V8**, **TypeScript**, **Rust** and **Tokio** (event loop).

## Why We Sould Use **Deno**

- **JavaScript** has changed significantly since **Node** was designed in 2009. Notably, Promises/async/await, ES modules, typed arrays and **TypeScript**.
- **Node** has some problems such as:
  - A poorly designed module system, with centralized distribution.
  - Lots of legacy APIs that must be supported.
  - Security.
- We want a **fun** and **productive** system for scripting. So a good scripting platform is too useful of a tool to shrug and accept the status quo. Neither **Node** nor **Python** nor **Ruby** are satisfactory.
- **Deno** is a single executable file. It will always and forever be distributed as such. The executable is **all you will ever need** to run any **Deno** program.
- **Deno** ships on **Mac**, **Linux** and **Windows**.
- **Deno** is secure execution by default. For example:

    ```txt
    > deno https://deno.land/welcome.ts
    Welcome to Deno
    ```

    But it's untrusted. To access disk, network, subprocesses, or environmental variables the user must opt in with a command-line flag. For example:

    ```txt
    --allow-read=/tmp
    --allow-write
    --allow-net=google.com
    --allow-env
    ```

    By default you don't access to anything.

## Browser Compatibility

- **Deno** is a bit like a web browser for scripts.
- **Deno** uses browser APIs. It does not aim to support all browser APIs. They and different goals. You can see some idea of what's supported, look at the global variables:

    ```js
    queueMicrotask, window, atob, btoa, fetch, clearTimeout, clearInterval, setTimeout, setInterval, location, onload, onunload, crypto, Blob, File, CustomEvent, Event, EventTarget, URL, URLSearchParams, Headers, FormData, TextEncoder, TextDecoder, Request, Response, performance, onmessage, postMessage, Worker, addEventListener, dispatchEvent, removeEventListener.
    ```

- You can import modules from URLs. For example:

    ```js
    import { serve } from "https://deno.land/std/http/server.ts";
    ```

    No notion of "node_modules" nor "index.js". The runtime fetches, caches, and compiles code transparently. So you can work offile using download cache.

## Some **Deno**'s Features

- The **TypeScript** compiler is compiled into **Deno**.
- Using **V8 Snapshots** to start up the **TypeScript** compiler quickly.
- **TypeScript** is a first class language. So users import URLs to **TypeScript** code directly (with `.ts` extension).
- **Deno** ships type definition for the runtime.
- **JavaScript** is also a first class language. It executes very quickly, being routed directly into **V8**.
- Enable a smooth transition from **JavaScript** to **TypeScript** to **Rust** as code matures.
- **Deno** has an opportunity to simplify the mental model by making an explicit correspondence between **modules** and code file. This is how browser users think about ES modules. In **Node** this is not the case:

    ```js
    import React from "react";
    import { Box, Grid } from "@material-ui/core";
    import { initializeApp } from "@firebase/app";
    ```

    It is not obvious where to find out is being impoted. So in **Deno** we have this concept: `Module == File == URL`.
- **Deno** will be a full sort of development environment.

## **Rust** Integration

- **Deno** was originally prototyped in **Go**, but now is a solidly **Rust** project.
- **Deno** is not a monolithic program like **Node**, but rather a collection of **Rust** crates.
- **Deno** want to allow users to build their own executables (thin **Electron** app).
