## Deno

- Like **Node**, allows one to execute **JavaScript** outside of the web browser.
- Like **Node**, uses the **V8 JavaScript** VM from Chrome.
- Like **Node**, it is open source with the MIT License.
- Written in **Rust** instead of **C++**.
- Built-in dev tools: testing, linting, formatting, doc gen.
- Can be embedded in other software (**deno_core**, **rusty_v8**).
- Designed to appeal to the broadest audience of developers standard APIs.
- **Deno** is a browser for command line scripts.
- **Deno** makes programming easy by letting you import and run code straight from the internet. For example:

    ```js
    import { serve } from "https://deno.land/std@0.56.0/http/server.ts";
    ```

- **Deno** is a secure sandbox which can optionally reach into the OS when given permission.

## Roadmap

- Fix bugs, fix bugs, and then fix more bugs.
- **Deno** is API stable for the foreseeable future.
- Minor 1.x releases with new features on a monthly cadence.
- *op creates*: allows **deno_core** to be more useful.
- GPU APIs (WebGPU) to support machine learning applications.
- `deno compile` a feature that compiles **JavaScript** to binary executable file.
