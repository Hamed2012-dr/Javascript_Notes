## Dynamic and Weakly Typed Languages

- In **JavaScript** code can change at runtime (e.g. type of a variable).
- Data types are assumed (e.g. assigned to variables) automatically.
- You don't define that some variable has to hold a certain value (e.g. a number).
- Data types are not set in stone but can change.
