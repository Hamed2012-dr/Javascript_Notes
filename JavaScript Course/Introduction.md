# What is **JavaScript**

- **JavaScript** is a dynamic, weakly typed programming language which is compiled at runtime. It can be executed as part of a webpage in a browser or directly on any machine (host environment).
- **JavaScript** was created to make webpages more dynamic (e.g. change content on a page directly from inside the brower). Originally, it was called **LiveScript** but duo to popularity of **Java**, it was renamed to **JavaScript**.
- **JavaScript** is totally independent from **Java** and has nothing in common with **Java** (like car and carpet).
