# Basics Variables, Data Types, Operators & Functions

- **JavaScript** file extension must be `.js`.
- You can put your scripts in `<script> </script>` tag in HTML directly. But don't do that. Always set a reference for that (with `src` attribute). For example:

    ```html
    <script src="assets/scripts/app.js"></script>
    ```

- To make sure to load the page first and then load the script, you can put your script to the end of the `body` tag. For example:

    ```html
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">

    <head>
      <meta charset="UTF-8" />
      <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    </head>

    <body>
      <script src="assets/scripts/app.js"></script> <!-- Here -->
    </body>

    </html>
    ```

- You sould import all dependencies files for a file before using it. For example:

    ```html
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">

    <head>
      <meta charset="UTF-8" />
      <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    </head>

    <body>
      <script src="assets/scripts/app_dependencies_1.js"></script> <!-- Here -->
      <script src="assets/scripts/app_dependencies_2.js"></script> <!-- Here -->
      <script src="assets/scripts/app_dependencies_3.js"></script> <!-- Here -->
      <script src="assets/scripts/app.js"></script> <!-- Here -->
    </body>

    </html>
    ```

- A variable is a **data container** or a **data storage** which holds some data. You can define a variable by typing `let` (as of ES6) keyword. You can change the variable value during the program. For example:

    ```js
    let userName = "Hamed";

    userName = "Ali";
    ```

- A constant is a **data container** or a **data storage** which holds some fixed data. You can define a constant by typing `const` (as of ES6) keyword. You **can't** change the constant value during the program. For example:

    ```js
    const USER_ID = 5;

    USER_ID = 6; // TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.
    ```

- Use constants as often as possible (i.e. whenever you actually got data that never changes) to be clear about your intentions (in your code).
- **JavaScript** is case sensitive.
- There are some rule to name your variables:

    ```js
    // === Allowed ===
    let userName = "Hamed"; // best practice: camelCase

    let ageGroup5 = 23; // only letters and digits

    let $kindOfSpecial = "Reza";

    let _internalValue = 1000;

    // === Not Recommended ===
    let user_name = "Hamed"; // allowed but bad practice (snake_case)

    // === Not Allowed ===
    let 21Players = 21;

    let user-b = "Ali"; // no special characters

    let let = true; // no keywords
    ```

- You **can't** omit the semi-colon when having two expressions in one line. For example: `let const a = 1; let const b = 2;`. Otherwise you can (optional).
- Consider:

    ```js
    let currentResult = 0;

    currentResult = currentResult + 10;
    ```

    On the right side of the `=`, we're referring to `currentResult`. You could say: We're reading (& using) its current value.
- These are primary operators for **JavaScript**:
    |Operator|Description|
    |:-:|:-:|
    |`+`|Add two numbers|
    |`-`|Subtract two numbers|
    |`*`|Multiply two numbers|
    |`/`|Divide two numbers|
    |`%`|Divide two numbers, yield remainder|
    |`**`|Expotentiation (e.g. `2 ** 3 = 8`)
    |`=`|Assign value to a variable|
- These are primary **Data Types** in **JavaScript**:
    |Data Type|Example(s)|
    |:-:|:-:|
    |Numbers|`2`, `-3`, `22.956`|
    |Strings (Text)|`'Hi'`, `"Hi"`, ``` `Hi` ```|
- You can concat strings with `+` opeator.
- HTML and **JavaScript** are executing their code from top to bottom.
- You can use single quotes inside the double quotes.
- You can use ``` ` ``` (backtick) operator to string concatination with one or more expressions (put the expressions inside the `${}`). For example:

    ```js
    let name = "Hamed";

    console.log(`Hi my name is ${name}. What's your name?!`);
    // Hi my name is Hamed. What's your name?!
    ```

    It's also known as **template literal**.
- You can print multi-line strings by using template literal (`white-space` CSS attribute must be set as `pre`). For example:

    ```js
    console.log(`
    Hello
      My
        Name
    Is
     Hamed
    `);
    /*
    Hello
      My
        Name
    Is
     Hamed
    /*
    ```

- You can use `\n` (**n**ew line) escape character to add a line-break to the output. For example:

    ```js
    console.log("Hamed\nAlavi");
    // Hamed
    // Alavi
    ```

- Consider:

    ```js
    function greetUser(name) {
        alert("Hi " + name);
    }
    ```

    You can define a function with `function` keyword, a name (`greetUser`), one or some parameters (`name`), and its body (between two curly braces). Parameters are optional. You can also return a value from a function with `return` keyword (it's optional). For example:

    ```js
    function sum(a, b) {
        let result = a + b;
        return result;
    }
    ```

- You can execute a function in your program by calling its name + `()`. `()` in **JavaScript** means execute. For example:

    ```js
    printHello();
    sum(5, 10);
    ```
