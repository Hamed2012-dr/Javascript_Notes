# Basics Variables, Data Types, Operators & Functions

- **JavaScript** file extension must be `.js`.
- You can put your scripts in `<script> </script>` tag in HTML directly. But don't do that. Always set a reference for that (with `src` attribute). For example:

    ```html
    <script src="assets/scripts/app.js"></script>
    ```

- To make sure to load the page first and then load the script, you can put your script to the end of the `body` tag. For example:

    ```html
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">

    <head>
      <meta charset="UTF-8" />
      <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    </head>

    <body>
      <script src="assets/scripts/app.js"></script> <!-- Here -->
    </body>

    </html>
    ```

- You sould import all dependencies files for a file before using it. For example:

    ```html
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">

    <head>
      <meta charset="UTF-8" />
      <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    </head>

    <body>
      <script src="assets/scripts/app_dependencies_1.js"></script> <!-- Here -->
      <script src="assets/scripts/app_dependencies_2.js"></script> <!-- Here -->
      <script src="assets/scripts/app_dependencies_3.js"></script> <!-- Here -->
      <script src="assets/scripts/app.js"></script> <!-- Here -->
    </body>

    </html>
    ```

- A variable is a **data container** or a **data storage** which holds some data. You can define a variable by typing `let` (as of ES6) keyword. You can change the variable value during the program. For example:

    ```js
    let userName = "Hamed";

    userName = "Ali";
    ```

- A constant is a **data container** or a **data storage** which holds some fixed data. You can define a constant by typing `const` (as of ES6) keyword. You **can't** change the constant value during the program. For example:

    ```js
    const USER_ID = 5;

    USER_ID = 6; // TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.
    ```

- Use constants as often as possible (i.e. whenever you actually got data that never changes) to be clear about your intentions (in your code).
