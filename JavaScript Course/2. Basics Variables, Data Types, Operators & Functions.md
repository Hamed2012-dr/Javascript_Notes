# Basics Variables, Data Types, Operators & Functions

- **JavaScript** file extension must be `.js`.
- You can put your scripts in `<script> </script>` tag in HTML directly. But don't do that. Always set a reference for that (with `src` attribute). For example:

    ```html
    <script src="assets/scripts/app.js"></script>
    ```

- To make sure to load the page first and then load the script, you can put your script to the end of the `body` tag. For example:

    ```html
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">

    <head>
      <meta charset="UTF-8" />
      <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    </head>

    <body>
      <script src="assets/scripts/app.js"></script> <!-- Here -->
    </body>

    </html>
    ```

- You sould import all dependencies files for a file before using it. For example:

    ```html
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">

    <head>
      <meta charset="UTF-8" />
      <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    </head>

    <body>
      <script src="assets/scripts/app_dependencies_1.js"></script> <!-- Here -->
      <script src="assets/scripts/app_dependencies_2.js"></script> <!-- Here -->
      <script src="assets/scripts/app_dependencies_3.js"></script> <!-- Here -->
      <script src="assets/scripts/app.js"></script> <!-- Here -->
    </body>

    </html>
    ```

- A variable is a **data container** or a **data storage** which holds some data. You can define a variable by typing `let` (as of ES6) keyword. You can change the variable value during the program. For example:

    ```js
    let userName = "Hamed";

    userName = "Ali";
    ```

- A constant is a **data container** or a **data storage** which holds some fixed data. You can define a constant by typing `const` (as of ES6) keyword. You **can't** change the constant value during the program. For example:

    ```js
    const USER_ID = 5;

    USER_ID = 6; // TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.
    ```

- Use constants as often as possible (i.e. whenever you actually got data that never changes) to be clear about your intentions (in your code).
- **JavaScript** is case sensitive.
- There are some rule to name your variables:

    ```js
    // === Allowed ===
    let userName = "Hamed"; // best practice: camelCase

    let ageGroup5 = 23; // only letters and digits

    let $kindOfSpecial = "Reza";

    let _internalValue = 1000;

    // === Not Recommended ===
    let user_name = "Hamed"; // allowed but bad practice (snake_case)

    // === Not Allowed ===
    let 21Players = 21;

    let user-b = "Ali"; // no special characters

    let let = true; // no keywords
    ```

- You **can't** omit the semi-colon when having two expressions in one line. For example: `let const a = 1; let const b = 2;`. Otherwise you can (optional).
- Consider:

    ```js
    let currentResult = 0;

    currentResult = currentResult + 10;
    ```

    On the right side of the `=`, we're referring to `currentResult`. You could say: We're reading (& using) its current value.
- These are primary operators for **JavaScript**:
    |Operator|Description|
    |:-:|:-:|
    |`+`|Add two numbers|
    |`-`|Subtract two numbers|
    |`*`|Multiply two numbers|
    |`/`|Divide two numbers|
    |`%`|Divide two numbers, yield remainder|
    |`**`|Expotentiation (e.g. `2 ** 3 = 8`)
    |`=`|Assign value to a variable|
    |`+=`|Compound addition assignment|
    |`-=`|Compound subtraction assignment|
    |`*=`|Compound multiplication assignment|
    |`/=`|Compound division assignment|
    |`++`|Increment|
    |`--`|Decrement|
- These are primary **Data Types** in **JavaScript**:
    |Data Type|Example(s)|
    |:-:|:-:|
    |Numbers|`2`, `-3`, `22.956`|
    |Strings (Text)|`'Hi'`, `"Hi"`, ``` `Hi` ```|
    |Booleans|`true`/`false`|
    |Objects|`{name: "Hamed", age: 23}`|
    |Arrays|`[1, 3, 5]`|
- You can concat strings with `+` opeator.
- HTML and **JavaScript** are executing their code from top to bottom.
- You can use single quotes inside the double quotes.
- You can use ``` ` ``` (backtick) operator to string concatination with one or more expressions (put the expressions inside the `${}`). For example:

    ```js
    let name = "Hamed";

    console.log(`Hi my name is ${name}. What's your name?!`);
    // Hi my name is Hamed. What's your name?!
    ```

    It's also known as **template literal**.
- You can print multi-line strings by using template literal (`white-space` CSS attribute must be set as `pre`). For example:

    ```js
    console.log(`
    Hello
      My
        Name
    Is
     Hamed
    `);
    /*
    Hello
      My
        Name
    Is
     Hamed
    /*
    ```

- You can use `\n` (**n**ew line) escape character to add a line-break to the output. For example:

    ```js
    console.log("Hamed\nAlavi");
    // Hamed
    // Alavi
    ```

- Consider:

    ```js
    function greetUser(name) {
        alert("Hi " + name);
    }
    ```

    You can define a function with `function` keyword, a name (`greetUser`), one or some parameters (`name`), and its body (between two curly braces). Parameters are optional. You can also return a value from a function with `return` keyword (it's optional). For example:

    ```js
    function sum(a, b) {
        let result = a + b;
        return result;
    }
    ```

- You can execute a function in your program by calling its name + `()`. `()` in **JavaScript** means execute. For example:

    ```js
    printHello(); // Hello World!
    sum(5, 10); // 15
    ```

- If you declare a function, it will be hoisted (which not possible for variables and constants you defined with `let` and `const`). For example:

    ```js
    sum(10, 20);

    function sum(a, b) {
        return a + b;
    }

    hamed = 24; // ReferenceError: Cannot access 'hamed' before initialization
    let hamed = 23;
    ```

- After the function declaration body (`{}`), you don't have a semicolon(`;`). You could add one, but typically you don't do that.
- Function parameters(variables) are only available inside the function body. For example:

    ```js
    function Multiply(num1, num2) {
        return num1 * num2*;
    }

    console.log(num1); // ReferenceError: num1 is not defined
    ```

- `alert(..)` function will stop the program from executing.
- The `return` will finishes the function execution. So any code that you have thereafter the `return` keyword, won't execute. For example:

    ```js
    function add(num1, num2) {
        const result = num1 + num2;
        return result;

        console.log("Won't execute");
    }
    ```

- It's not good idea to change outside values from a function. But if you want do that, don't return any value from it.
- All numbers in HTML code (inputs and etc) are `string`. You can convert them to integer with `parseInt(..)` or to float with `parseFloat(..)`. For example:

    ```js
    let result = parseInt(input.value); // value was: "23"

    console.log(typeof input.value); // string
    console.log(typeof result); // number (int)
    ```

- There is another way to convert `string` to `number` by using `+` operator before that `string`. If that value was a `float` it will return a float. Otherwise, it will return integer. For example:

    ```js
    let result1 = +input1.value; // value was: "23"
    let result2 = +input2.value; // value was: "23.6"

    console.log(typeof result1); // number (int)
    console.log(typeof result2); // number (float)
    ```

    But if you want exactly (explicitly) an integer or a float number, you should use `parseInt(..)` or `parseFloat(..)`.
- You can convert a `number` to a `string` by using built-in `toString()` function. For example:

    ```js
    let price = 1000;

    console.log(typeof price); // number
    console.log(price.toString()); // string
    ```

- You should avoid repeating code as much as possible to make your program more performant, It will save your time too. Consider:

    ```js
    function add() {
        const calcDescription = `${currentResult} + ${parseInt(userInput.value)}`;
        currentResult = currentResult + parseInt(userInput.value);
        outputResult(currentResult, calcDescription);
    }
    ```

    Instead of that, you can do something like this:

    ```js
    function add() {
        const enteredNumber = parseInt(usrInput.value);
        const calcDescription = `${currentResult} + ${enteredNumber}`;
        currentResult = currentResult + enteredNumber;
        outputResult(currentResult, calcDescription);
    }
    ```

- You can comment your code to make it more understandable and easier to read for other people (developers). Comments won't execute in you program and they're ignored by **JavaScript** compiler. There are two way for commenting in **JavaScript**: single-line comment (`//`) and multi-line comment (`/**/`). For example:

    ```js
    // This is a single-line comment

    /*
    This
    is
    a
    multi-line
    comment
    */

    callMyName(/*default value is: "Hamed"*/); // from hamed.js file
    ```

- In **JavaScript** you can use compound assignment (concise) instead normal assignment with the same result. For example:

    ```js
    let currentResult = 0;

    currentResult = currentResult + 10; // normal assignment
    currentResult += 10; // compound assignment
    ```

    This also works with `-`, `*`, and `/` operators.
- There is a concise form (`++` and `--`) for compound assignment with plus one `+ 1` or minus one `- 1`. Consider:

    ```js
    let firstValue = 0;
    let secondVaue = 0;

    firstValue = firstValue + 1;
    secondValue = secondValue - 1;

    console.log(firstValue); // 1
    console.log(secondValue); // -1
    ```

    This snippet is equal to:

    ```js
    let firstValue = 0;
    let secondVaue = 0;

    firstValue++;
    secondValue--;

    console.log(firstValue); // 1
    console.log(secondValue); // -1
    ```

    If you put `++` or `--` before the value, it will change the value before returning it. For example:

    ```js
    let num1 = 10;
    let num2 = 20;

    console.log(num1++); // 10
    console.log(num1); // 11

    console.log(++num2); // 21
    console.log(num2); // 21
    ```

- You can add an element to an array with built-in `push(..)` function. For example:

    ```js
    let myArray = [];

    myArray.push(1);
    myArray.push(2);

    console.log(myArray); // [ 1, 2 ]
    ```

- Arrays Indexes always starts with `0` in **JavaScript** (aka zero-based). For example:

    ```js
    let myArray = [];

    myArray.push(1);

    console.log(myArray[0]); // 1
    ```
