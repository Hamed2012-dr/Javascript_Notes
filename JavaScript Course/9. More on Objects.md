# More on Objects

- Objects are core (super important) data structure in **JavaScript**.
- Objects are made of properties and methods and you could say **properties** are variables in an object and **methods** are functions in an object. So you would store data in properties and actions in methods.
- Objects allows you to group related data together and split your code into logical pieces.
- In **JavaScript**, reference values are objects. For example literal objects (`{..}`), Arrays, DOM Nodes and other built-in objects.
- In **JavaScript**, adding properties on the fly to the objects is super easy. You just extend with the dot notation and assign a value. It doesn't matter if that property was part before or not. For example:

    ```js
    let person = {
        name: "Hamed",
        age: 23,
        hobbies: ["Programming", "Gaming"],
        greet: function () {
            alert("Hi there");
        }
    };

    // ...

    person.age = 24;
    person.isAdmin = true;

    console.log(person);
    /*
    {
        name: 'Hamed',
        age: 24,
        hobbies: [ 'Programming', 'Gaming' ],
        greet: [Function: greet],
        isAdmin: true
    }
    */
    ```

- You can delete the object properties or methods with `delete` keyword. For example:

    ```js
    const person = {
        firstName: "Hamed",
        lastName: "Alavi",
        age: 23,
        greet: function () {
            alert("Hi there");
        },
        isAdmin: false
    }

    delete person.greet;
    delete person.isAdmin;
    console.log(person); // { firstName: 'Hamed', lastName: 'Alavi', age: 23 }
    ```

    Please **Don't** set a property with `undefined`. It's a super bad idea. For example:

    ```js
    const person = {
        name: "Hamed",
        age: 23
    }

    person.age = undefined;
    ```

- In **JavaScript**, anything which you can use as a variable can be used as a key name and keys are even more flexible than variables. Any key you enter is automatically coerced to string. For example:

    ```js
    // both `firstName` and `"lastName"` in the end will be string
    const person = {
        firstName: "Hamed",
        "lastName": "Alavi"
    }

    console.log(person); // { firstName: 'Hamed', lastName: 'Alavi' }
    ```

- You can access the object's special keys (e.g. with whitespace or dash) with square brackets(`[]`). For example:

    ```js
    const person = {
        "first name": "Hamed",
        "last-name": "Alavi"
    }

    console.log(person["first name"]); // Hamed
    console.log(person["last-name"]); // Alavi
    console.log(person); // { 'first name': 'Hamed', 'last-name': Alavi }
    ```

    Always pass a string to square brackets. If you don't do that, **JavaScript Engine** will look out of the object and then try to read that variable. For example:

    ```js
    const firstName = "age";
    const person = {
        firstName: "Hamed",
        lastName: "Alavi",
        age: 23
    }

    console.log(person[firstName]); // 23
    ```

- Dot notation (`.`) wouldn't work for accessing object's property which their key is a number, so you should use square brackets. You can also omit the quotation marks for numbers. For example:

    ```js
    const person = {
        name: "Hamed",
        age: 30,
        0: false,
        1.5: true
    }

    console.log(person.1.5); // SyntaxError missing ) after argument list
    console.log(person["1.5"]); // true
    console.log(person[1.5]); // true
    ```

- If you have an object with only numbers, the numbers will be sorted. That makes sense, think about arrays. Arrays are objects with number keys where the order should be guaranteed (ascending). Otherwise if you have string keys, the insertion order will be kept.

    ```js
    const numObj = {
        6: "Hamed",
        2: "Alavi",
        1: 23
    }

    console.log(numObj); // { '1': 23, '2': 'Alavi', '6': 'Hamed' }
    ```
