# More on Objects

- Objects are core (super important) data structure in **JavaScript**.
- Objects are made of properties and methods and you could say **properties** are variables in an object and **methods** are functions in an object. So you would store data in properties and actions in methods.
- Objects allows you to group related data together and split your code into logical pieces.
- In **JavaScript**, reference values are objects. For example literal objects (`{..}`), Arrays, DOM Nodes and other built-in objects.
- In **JavaScript**, adding properties on the fly to the objects is super easy. You just extend with the dot notation and assign a value. It doesn't matter if that property was part before or not. For example:

    ```js
    let person = {
        name: "Hamed",
        age: 23,
        hobbies: ["Programming", "Gaming"],
        greet: function () {
            alert("Hi there");
        }
    };

    // ...

    person.age = 24;
    person.isAdmin = true;

    console.log(person);
    /*
    {
        name: 'Hamed',
        age: 24,
        hobbies: [ 'Programming', 'Gaming' ],
        greet: [Function: greet],
        isAdmin: true
    }
    */
    ```

- You can delete the object properties or methods with `delete` keyword. For example:

    ```js
    const person = {
        firstName: "Hamed",
        lastName: "Alavi",
        age: 23,
        greet: function () {
            alert("Hi there");
        },
        isAdmin: false
    }

    delete person.greet;
    delete person.isAdmin;
    console.log(person); // { firstName: 'Hamed', lastName: 'Alavi', age: 23 }
    ```

    Please **Don't** set a property with `undefined`. It's a super bad idea. For example:

    ```js
    const person = {
        name: "Hamed",
        age: 23
    }

    person.age = undefined;
    ```
