# More on Objects

- Objects are core (super important) data structure in **JavaScript**.
- Objects are made of properties and methods and you could say **properties** are variables in an object and **methods** are functions in an object. So you would store data in properties and actions in methods.
- Objects allows you to group related data together and split your code into logical pieces.
- In **JavaScript**, reference values are objects. For example literal objects (`{..}`), Arrays, DOM Nodes and other built-in objects.
- In **JavaScript**, adding properties on the fly to the objects is super easy. You just extend with the dot notation and assign a value. It doesn't matter if that property was part before or not. For example:

    ```js
    let person = {
        name: "Hamed",
        age: 23,
        hobbies: ["Programming", "Gaming"],
        greet: function () {
            alert("Hi there");
        }
    };

    // ...

    person.age = 24;
    person.isAdmin = true;

    console.log(person);
    /*
    {
        name: 'Hamed',
        age: 24,
        hobbies: [ 'Programming', 'Gaming' ],
        greet: [Function: greet],
        isAdmin: true
    }
    */
    ```

- You can delete the object properties or methods with `delete` keyword. For example:

    ```js
    const person = {
        firstName: "Hamed",
        lastName: "Alavi",
        age: 23,
        greet: function () {
            alert("Hi there");
        },
        isAdmin: false
    }

    delete person.greet;
    delete person.isAdmin;
    console.log(person); // { firstName: 'Hamed', lastName: 'Alavi', age: 23 }
    ```

    Please **Don't** set a property with `undefined`. It's a super bad idea. For example:

    ```js
    const person = {
        name: "Hamed",
        age: 23
    }

    person.age = undefined;
    ```

- In **JavaScript**, anything which you can use as a variable can be used as a key name and keys are even more flexible than variables. Any key you enter is automatically coerced to string. For example:

    ```js
    // both `firstName` and `"lastName"` in the end will be string
    const person = {
        firstName: "Hamed",
        "lastName": "Alavi"
    }

    console.log(person); // { firstName: 'Hamed', lastName: 'Alavi' }
    ```

- You can access the object's special keys (e.g. with whitespace or dash) with square brackets(`[]`). For example:

    ```js
    const person = {
        "first name": "Hamed",
        "last-name": "Alavi"
    }

    console.log(person["first name"]); // Hamed
    console.log(person["last-name"]); // Alavi
    console.log(person); // { 'first name': 'Hamed', 'last-name': Alavi }
    ```

    Always pass a string to square brackets. If you don't do that, **JavaScript Engine** will look out of the object and then try to read that variable. For example:

    ```js
    const firstName = "age";
    const person = {
        firstName: "Hamed",
        lastName: "Alavi",
        age: 23
    }

    console.log(person[firstName]); // 23
    ```

- Dot notation (`.`) wouldn't work for accessing object's property which their key is a number, so you should use square brackets. You can also omit the quotation marks for numbers. For example:

    ```js
    const person = {
        name: "Hamed",
        age: 30,
        0: false,
        1.5: true
    }

    console.log(person.1.5); // SyntaxError missing ) after argument list
    console.log(person["1.5"]); // true
    console.log(person[1.5]); // true
    ```

- If you have an object with only numbers, the numbers will be sorted. That makes sense, think about arrays. Arrays are objects with number keys where the order should be guaranteed (ascending). Otherwise if you have string keys, the insertion order will be kept.

    ```js
    const numObj = {
        6: "Hamed",
        2: "Alavi",
        1: 23
    }

    console.log(numObj); // { '1': 23, '2': 'Alavi', '6': 'Hamed' }
    ```

- ES6 adds computed property names, where you can specifiy an expression, surrounded by a `[]` pair, in the key-name position of an object-literal declaration. For example:

    ```js
    const userChosenKeyName = "level";
    const myObject = {
        [userChosenKeyName]: "..."
    };

    console.log(myObject.level); // ...
    ```

- If you have a property name which is exactly equal to your value name, you could actually omit the value name and the colon (`:`) and **JavaScript** behind the scenes will automatically do it like a normal key-value pair for you. (`key: "value"`). For example:

    ```js
    const person = {
        name: "name"
    }
    // it's equal to:
    const person = {
        name
    }
    ```

- Always use property and method chaining. It simply saves you the hassle of splitting unnecessarily code across multiple lines with helper variables in between. For example:

    ```js
    const softwares = {
        threeDimensional: {
            blender: {
                renderEngine: "cycle",
                realtimeRenderEngine: "eevee"
            }
        }
    };

    console.log(softwares.threeDimensional.blender.realtimeRenderEngine); // eevee
    ```

- You can copy an object with spread operator (`...`). For example:

    ```js
    const person = {
        name: "Hamed",
        age: 23,
        hobbies: ["Coding", "Gaming", "Reading"]
    };
    const person2 = { ... person };

    console.log(person2); // { name: 'Hamed', age: 23, hobbies: [ 'Coding', 'Gaming', 'Reading' ] }
    ```

    The spread operator does not do a deep copy where it goes through all level of nested reference values, instead it just copies the top level key-value pairs into a brand new object and any nested reference values (the addresses) are kept. Consider:

    ```js
    const person = {
        name: "Hamed",
        age: 23,
        hobbies: ["Coding", "Gaming", "Reading"]
    };
    const person2 = { ... person };

    person.hobbies.push("Cooking");
    console.log(person2); // { name: 'Hamed', age: 23, hobbies: [ 'Coding', 'Gaming', 'Reading', 'Cooking' ] }
    ```

    You should copy (overwrite) those manually (with a value or with the spread operator). For example:

    ```js
    const person = {
        name: "Hamed",
        age: 23,
        hobbies: ["Coding", "Gaming", "Reading"]
    };
    const person2 = { ...person, age: 24, hobbies: [...person.hobbies] };

    person.hobbies.pop();
    console.log(person); // { name: 'Hamed', age: 23, hobbies: [ 'Coding', 'Gaming' ] }
    console.log(person2); // { name: 'Hamed', age: 24, hobbies: [ 'Coding', 'Gaming', 'Reading' ] }
    ```

- There is another way for copying objects in **JavaScript**. The `Object.assign(..)` method will spit out a new object and merge all the key-value pairs of the other arguments into that new object. For example:

    ```js
    const person = { name: "Hamed" };
    const person2 = Object.assign({}, person);

    console.log(person2); // { name: 'Hamed' }
    ```

    You can also use an existing object as target object. For example:

    ```js
    const person = { name: "Hamed" };
    const person2 = { age: 23 };
    const person3 = Object.assign(person, person2);

    console.log(person3); // { name: 'Hamed', age: 23 }
    ```

    The spread operator (`...`) would be my recommendation, because it's a bit shorter.
- You can use object destructing to pull out the key-value pair of an object and store it in a new variable (order doesn't matter in objects, so you must enter the exact key name for the variable). For example:

    ```js
    const person = {
        name: "Hamed",
        age: 23
    };
    const { name } = person;

    console.log(name); // Hamed
    ```

    If you want to use a different name (because maybe otherwise you would have a clash with another variable name you're using or anything like that), you can assign a new name to that pulled out value by adding a colon (`:`); For example:

    ```js
    const name = "Hamed";
    const person = {
        name: "Hamed",
        age: 23
    }
    const { name: myName } = person;

    console.log(myName); // Hamed
    ```
