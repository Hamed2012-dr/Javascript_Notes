# More on Objects

- Objects are core (super important) data structure in **JavaScript**.
- Objects are made of properties and methods and you could say **properties** are variables in an object and **methods** are functions in an object. So you would store data in properties and actions in methods.
- Objects allows you to group related data together and split your code into logical pieces.
- In **JavaScript**, reference values are objects. For example literal objects (`{..}`), Arrays, DOM Nodes and other built-in objects.
