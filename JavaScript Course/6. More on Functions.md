# More on Functions

- If you store a function in such a property (key) in an object, then you call it a **method**, but a method is nothing else than a function attached to an object. For example:

    ```js
    const helpBtn = document.getElementById("help-btn");

    function help() {
        console.log("Helping someone");
    }

    helpBtn.addEventListener("click", help);
    ```

    In this snippet, `getElementById(..)` and `addEventListener(..)` are methods.
- In **JavaScript**, functions themselves also are objects. Basically anything that applies to objects (e.g. their reference types) also applies to functions.
- In **JavaScript**, you can store functions in variables and constants. So you can use a function as an expression. For exmaple:

    ```js
    const name = function myName() {
        console.log("Hamed");
    }

    name(); // Hamed
    ```

- You have to define and initialize your functions before trying to call them if you use them as expressions. They will be hoisted like normal function declaration, but they can't be declared anywhere in the file. So it just forces you to define functions before you call them. For example:

    ```js
    multiply(4, 6); // ReferenceError: Cannot access 'multiply' before initialization

    const multiply = function (a, b) {
        return a * b;
    }
    ```

- You can give a name to anonymous functions to make debugging easier. Consider:

    ```js
    const helpBtn = document.getElementById("help-btn");

    helpBtn.addEventListener("click", function () {
        console.log("Thank you bro" + name); // note that the `name` doesn't exist for producing an error
    });
    /*
    If you click on help button, you will get this error:
    Uncaugh ReferenceError: name is not defined
    at HTMLButtonElement.<anonymous>
    */
    ```

    After giving a name to anonymous function:

    ```js
    const helpBtn = document.getElementById("help-btn");

    helpBtn.addEventListener("click", function someName() {
        console.log("Thank you bro " + point); // note that the `point` doesn't exist for producing an error
    });
    /*
    If you click on help button, you will get this error:
    Uncaugh ReferenceError: name is not defined
    at HTMLButtonElement.someName
    */
    ```

- As of ES6, there is a new way for defining our anonymous functions with syntactic sugar. It's called arrow functions (`() => {..}`). You always have to store them in some variables or use them in a place where you would use an anonymous function. Consider:

    ```js
    const sum = (num1, num2) => {
        return num1 + num2;
    }
    ```

    If you have an arrow function, where you only have one expression in it, you can actually omit the curly braces and also you then have to omit `return` keyword. For example:

    ```js
    const sum = (num1, num2) => num1 + num2;
    ```

    If you have only just paramter in a function, you can also omit the parentheses. For example:

    ```js
    const expo2 = num => num ** 2;
    ```

- In **JavaScript** you can assign a default value to a function parameters by adding an equal sign (`=`), then your default value. For example:

    ```js
    function sum(num1, num2 = 25) {
        return num1 + num2;
    }

    console.log(sum(10)); // 35
    ```
