# More on Functions

- If you store a function in such a property (key) in an object, then you call it a **method**, but a method is nothing else than a function attached to an object. For example:

    ```js
    const helpBtn = document.getElementById("help-btn");

    function help() {
        console.log("Helping someone");
    }

    helpBtn.addEventListener("click", help);
    ```

    In this snippet, `getElementById(..)` and `addEventListener(..)` are methods.
- In **JavaScript**, functions themselves also are objects. Basically anything that applies to objects (e.g. their reference types) also applies to functions.
- In **JavaScript**, you can store functions in variables and constants. So you can use a function as an expression. For exmaple:

    ```js
    const name = function myName() {
        console.log("Hamed");
    }

    name(); // Hamed
    ```
