# Async **JavaScript** Promises & Callbacks

- **JavaScript** is single-threaded. It means that **JavaScript** can only execute one task at a time. Consider this code:

    ```js
    console.log(..);
    someFunction();
    button.disabled = true;
    moreCode();
    ```

    All these steps run in sequence after each other. They're not running simultaneously next to each other, instead **JavaScript** will log something to the console, then call the function and do whatever needs to be done inside of that function, then go ahead and disable that button and then call that other function, so these things happen after each other, not at the same time. Now consider:

    ```js
    console.log(..);
    setTimeout(someFunction, 5000);
    moreCode();
    ```

    The problem is `setTimeout(..)` might take 2 seconds, 5 seconds, 10 seconds or maybe just 100 miliseconds, but even 100 miliseconds would be a duration we probably would not want to wait, because this operation could in general take longer and therefore block our code execution. So it prevents more code from being executed until `setTimeout(..)` is done. At least, if **JavaScript** would treat this in the same way as it would treat all other code blocks. Typically you don't want to block your entire script until these operations finish, because blocking your script would not just mean that the next line doesn't execute immediately, it would also mean that no other code can execute. Thankfully **JavaScript** and browsers have a solution for that. You have asynchronous code execution. The browser takes care of these tasks, manages them in multiple threads and therefore our **JavaScript** code is not blocked. Now the browser however needs a way for it to communicate back to our **JavaScript** code and for that, we typically use **callback** functions. For example:

    ```js
    const button = document.querySelector("button");

    function trackUserHandler() {
        console.log("Clicked!");
    }

    button.addEventListener("click", trackUserHandler);
    // === User clicked on the button ===
    // Clicked
    ```
