# Async **JavaScript** Promises & Callbacks

- **JavaScript** is single-threaded. It means that **JavaScript** can only execute one task at a time. Consider this code:

    ```js
    console.log(..);
    someFunction();
    button.disabled = true;
    moreCode();
    ```

    All these steps run in sequence after each other. They're not running simultaneously next to each other, instead **JavaScript** will log something to the console, then call the function and do whatever needs to be done inside of that function, then go ahead and disable that button and then call that other function, so these things happen after each other, not at the same time.
