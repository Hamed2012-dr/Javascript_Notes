# Efficient Development & Debugging

- You sould work in productive environment (i.e. IDE, editor).
- Choose an editor or an IDE that have auto-format code feature and have smart auto-compeletion and hits (intellisense).
- Try to explore extensions and settings.
- Use shortcuts as much as you can.
- **MDN** (**M**ozilla **D**eveloper **N**etwork) is the best place for **JavaScript** documentation. It's like the official **JavaScript** documentation if there were one.
- You should learn go to **Google** (seriously!).
- Use **Stack Overflow** forum. It's the best place for asking proper questions and helping others.
- Always ask proper questions to get proper responses and also help other, don't just ask, be friendly. Dive into the community because that will allow you to grow as a developer.
- In programming, it's absolutely normal that you have more than one way of solving/achieving something. For exmaple, you can use `Number(..)` instead `parseInt(..)`.
