# Working with the DOM (Browser HTML Code) in **JavaScript**

- We all know that the **JavaScript** can interact with the browser (with rendered HTML code). In the end that's called DOM (**D**ocumnet **O**bject **M**odel). In **JavaScript**, there are certain methods that allows us to reach out to the loaded HTML code. For example:

    ```js
    const el = document.querySelector("h1"); // to get `h1` tag from the browser
    ```

- DOM is not strictly tied to browsers. There are other tools that can parse HTML.
- The `document` object (it's a global object that all the browsers provides it) is the topmost entry point to get access to all that rendered HTML code. `document` provides you various methods and functionalities to get access to the elements, to query for elements, to query for HTML elements, to interact with DOM contents, so to interact with loaded HTML code.
- The `window` object (it's a global object that all the browsers provides it) gives you access to all the features that the browser want to expose to you. It acts as global storage for script, also provides access to window-specific properties and methods.
- You can see all properties and methods inside the `document` and `window` objects by putting them in `console.dir(..)` function. For example:

    ```js
    console.dir(window); // it have too many properties and methods
    ```

- The browser always looks in the `window` object if you're calling or accessing something that can't be found anywhere else. Whilst it's called window, it really just means the currently loaded tab (not other tabs). For example:

    ```js
    alert("Hamed"); // it's actually `window.alert("Hamed")`
    document.getElementById("Hamed"); // it's actually `window.document.getElementById("Hamed")`
    ```

- After parsing HTML code, all tags will be stored in the memory, and you can access them. These tags are called **elemenet node**. Not just HTML tags are loaded and created as objects, but also all text that you have, and these are created as so-called **Text Nodes**.
- You can get access to single elements from DOM with `querySelector(..)` and `getElementById(..)`. The `querySelector(..)` takes a CSS selector (even pseudo selectors are supported) and it gives you therefore a lot of flexibility and power when it comes to selecting elements with complex query in your DOM (it returns the first selected element). The `getElementById(..)` on the other hand takes an ID which you might have assigned to an HTML element and selects an element by that and since ID should be unique on your web page, because this is a method which returns one element. DOM Nodes are just **JavaScript** objects in the end (i.e. reference values). These methods return the object references (addresses).
- The `querySelectorAll(..)`, `getElementsByTagName(..)`, and etc, returns a collection of elements (array-like objects), typically a Nodelist. You have different ways of querying elements (e.g. by CSS selector, by tag name, by CSS class, and etc).
- Everything in the DOM is a Node. Elements are really just the Nodes which are created of HTML tags which were rendered, not the text in there. There are special properties and methods to interact with the elements. Available methods and properties depend on the kind of element. They can be created and removed via **JavaScript**.
