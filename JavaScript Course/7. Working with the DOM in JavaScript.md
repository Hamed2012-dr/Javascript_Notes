# Working with the DOM (Browser HTML Code) in **JavaScript**

- We all know that the **JavaScript** can interact with the browser (with rendered HTML code). In the end that's called DOM (**D**ocumnet **O**bject **M**odel). In **JavaScript**, there are certain methods that allows us to reach out to the loaded HTML code. For example:

    ```js
    const el = document.querySelector("h1"); // to get `h1` tag from the browser
    ```

- DOM is not strictly tied to browsers. There are other tools that can parse HTML.
- The `document` object (it's a global object that all the browsers provides it) is the topmost entry point to get access to all that rendered HTML code. `document` provides you various methods and functionalities to get access to the elements, to query for elements, to query for HTML elements, to interact with DOM contents, so to interact with loaded HTML code.
- The `window` object (it's a global object that all the browsers provides it) gives you access to all the features that the browser want to expose to you. It acts as global storage for script, also provides access to window-specific properties and methods.
