# Advanced Function Concepts

- In **JavaScript**, a **pure function** is a function which for some given input (arguments), always produces the same output, so the same arguments (values) always produce the same output. It also does not trigger any side effects, which means it does not change anything outside of the function. For example:

    ```js
    function add(num1, num2) {
        return num1 + num2;
    }

    console.log(add(1, 5)); // 6
    console.log(add(12, 15)); // 27
    ```

    An impure function is a function which is not pure. For example:

    ```js
    let previousResult = 0;

    function addMoreNumbers(num1, num2) {
        const sum = num1 + num2;
        previousResult = sum;
        return sum;
    }

    console.log(addMoreNumbers(4, 5)); // 9
    console.log(previousResult); // 9

    function addRandom(num) {
        return num + Math.random();
    }

    console.log(addRandom(5)); // a number between 5 and 6
    ```

- In **JavaScript**, a **factory function** is a function that produces another function. For example:

    ```js
    function createTaxCalculator(tax) {
        function calculateTax(amount) {
            return amount * tax;
        }

        return calculateTax;
    }

    const calculateVatAmount = createTaxCalculator(0.19);
    const incomeTaxAmount = createTaxCalculator(0.25);

    console.log(calculationVatAmount(100));
    console.log(calculationVatAmount(200));
    ```

- Every function in **JavaScript** is a closure. That simply means that inside of curly braces, if you create a variable in there or if you get a paramater, it's only usable inside of that function, but not outside of it. The more technical term for this would be that you have different lexical environments. Each function has its own lexical environment and variables and constants are registered in these different environments. Now why is it called a closure then? Because every function closes over the surrounding environment which means it registers the surrounding evnvironment and the variables resigtered there and it memorizes the values of these variables. If you then change a variable, that is reflected inside of the function, but if it does not change, the function still is able to use. For example the tax value (from previous the example) you passed in, when you created the outer function.
