# Classes & Object-oriented Programming (OOP)

- The idea behind object oriented programming is that you work with kind of real life entities in your code.
- Classes allow us to build objects in an easier way (or to build objects based on some blueprints **to be precise**), so we can easily recreate objects based on these classes, because indeed objects then are also called instances of classes. Therefore a class is just a definition of how the object looks like, which properties and methods it has. So the class-based creation is an alternative to using object literals.
- You can define a class with `class` keyword and a name for that class (**PascalCase**). For example:

    ```js
    class Product = {
        title = "DEFAULT";
        imageUrl;
        description;
        price;
    }

    const prod = new Product();
    ```

    As you can see, there is no colon (`:`), comma (`,`) and `let`, `var` or `const` in the class, instead we use equal sign (`=`) for assignment and semicolon (`;`) for separating multiple statements. You should create an instance of classes with `new` keyword before using them.

    ```js
    const productList = {
        products: [
            {
                title: "A Pillow",
                imageUrl: "https://b3h2.scene7.com/is/image/BedBathandBeyond/15364655025932m?$690$&wid=690&hei=690",
                price: 19.99,
                description: "A soft pillow"
            },
            {
                title: "A Carpet",
                imageUrl: "https://www.cpersia.com/16140-thickbox_default/birjand-carpet-ref-174132.jpg",
                price: 89.99,
                description: "A carpet which you might like - or not."
            }
        ],
        render() {
            const renderHook = document.getElementById("app");
            const prodList = document.createElement("ul");
            prodList.className = "product-list";
            for (const prod of this.products) {
                const prodEl = document.createElement("li");
                prodEl.className = "product-item";
                prodEl.innerHTML = `
                <div>
                    <img src="${prod.imageUrl}" alt="${prod.title}">
                    <div class="product-item__content">
                    <h2>${prod.title}</h2>
                    <h3>\$${prod.price}</h3>
                    <p>${prod.description}</p>
                    <button>Add to Cart</button>
                    </div>
                </div>
                `;
                prodList.append(prodEl);
            }
            renderHook.append(prodList);
        }
    };

    productList.render();
    ```
