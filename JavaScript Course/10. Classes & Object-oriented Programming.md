# Classes & Object-oriented Programming (OOP)

- The idea behind object oriented programming is that you work with kind of real life entities in your code.
- Classes allow us to build objects in an easier way (or to build objects based on some blueprints **to be precise**), so we can easily recreate objects based on these classes, because indeed objects then are also called instances of classes. Therefore a class is just a definition of how the object looks like, which properties and methods it has. So the class-based creation is an alternative to using object literals.
- You can define a class with `class` keyword and a name for that class (**PascalCase**). For example:

    ```js
    class Product = {
        // These are fields of the class
        title = "DEFAULT";
        imageUrl;
        description;
        price;

        firstName() {
            console.log("Hamed");
        }

        lastName() {
            console.log("Alavi");
        }
    }

    const prod = new Product();
    ```

    As you can see, there is no colon (`:`), comma (`,`) and `let`, `var` or `const` in the class, instead we use equal sign (`=`) for assignment and semicolon (`;`) for separating multiple statements. Methods are define like the object shorthand methods (without semicolon at the end). You should create an instance of classes with `new` keyword before using them.
- There is a special method in the class that can accept arguments like any normal method. That's `constructor` (that's a reserved name) method. You can assign the arguments to your class field with `this` keyword in the `constructor` method (`this` refers to the class). For example:

    ```js
    class Product = {
        // These are fields of the class
        title = "DEFAULT";
        imageUrl;
        description;
        price;

        constructor(title, image, desc, price) {
            this.title = title;
            this.imageUrl = image;
            this.description = desc;
            this.price = price;
        }
    }
    ```

- Using OOP programming in **JavaScript** would be a good choice for you in some places. Consider:

    ```js
    const productList = {
        products: [
            {
                title: "A Pillow",
                imageUrl: "https://b3h2.scene7.com/is/image/BedBathandBeyond/15364655025932m?$690$&wid=690&hei=690",
                price: 19.99,
                description: "A soft pillow"
            },
            {
                title: "A Carpet",
                imageUrl: "https://www.cpersia.com/16140-thickbox_default/birjand-carpet-ref-174132.jpg",
                price: 89.99,
                description: "A carpet which you might like - or not."
            }
        ]
    };
    ```

    You can convert this snippet to OOP sake like this:

    ```js
    class Product {
        title = "DEFAUL";
        imageUrl;
        description;
        price;

        constructor(title, image, desc, price) {
            this.title = title;
            this.imageUrl = image;
            this.description = desc;
            this.price = price;
        }
    }

    const productList = {
        products: [
            new Product(
                "A Pillow",
                "https://b3h2.scene7.com/is/image/BedBathandBeyond/15364655025932m?$690$&wid=690&hei=690",
                "A soft pillow",
                19.99
            ),
            new Product(
                "A Carpet",
                "https://www.cpersia.com/16140-thickbox_default/birjand-carpet-ref-174132.jpg",
                89.99,
                "A carpet which you might like - or not"
            )
        ]
    };
    ```

- In the `constructor`, you can add properties for the first time (without having defined fields for them before). For example:

    ```js
    class Product {
        constructor(title, image, desc, price) {
            this.title = title;
            this.imageUrl = image;
            this.description = desc;
            this.price = price;
        }
    }
    ```

- The `static` properties and methods are only accessible on the class itself, so you don't need to instantiate the class (you don't need to use the `new` keyword to create an object based on that class). We typically use this on helper classes or for some global configuration. But instance properties and methods are only accessible on the instances based on the class (should be defined **without** `static` keyword). We use that for all the core reusable logic. For example:

    ```js
    class App {
        static init() {
            const shop = new Shop();
            shop.render();
        }
    }

    App.init();
    ```
