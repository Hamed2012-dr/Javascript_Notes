# More on Numbers & Strings

- In **JavaScript**, every number is a float (with decimal places). Unlike other programming languages, **JavaScript** does not know special integer types. That means numbers like `5`, `-3` or `12` would actually be stored like `5.0`, `-3.0` or `12.0`. Numbers are stored as 64-bit floating points, so there are 64-bits available to internally represent a number (bits are these things which can be either 0 or 1). One bit is reserved for the sign (positive or negative number) and other bits are basically there to represent the digits of the number and where the dot is (where the decimal places sits).
- The biggest possible number you can represent with normal number type (the biggest integer) in **JavaScript** is `9007199254740991` (9 quadrillion). You can get it with `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER` property. For example:

    ```js
    console.log(Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER); // 9007199254740991
    ```

    You also have a `MIN_SAFE_INTEGER` which is essentially the same number with a negative sign in front of it (`-9007199254740991`). You also have a `MAX_VALUE` here and difference is that is actually a decimal number and that's `1.7976931348623157e+308`, so that's the biggest value you can work with in **JavaScript**. As you guessed, you also have a `MIN_VALUE` which is `5e-324`.
