# More on Arrays & Iterables

- An **iterable** is an object that implement the **iterable** protocol and have an **@@iterator** method (`Symbol.iterator`). They are objects where you can use the `for-of` loop. In **JavaScript**, not every iterable is an array. Other iterables are (for example): `NodeList`, `String`, `Map`, `Set`.
- An **array-like object** is a object that have a `length` property and use indexes to access items. In **JavaScript**, not every array-like object is an array. Other array-likes are (for example): `NodeList`, `String`.
- The most recommended way for creating an array is using brackets. That's also better from a performance perspective by the way. For example:

    ```js
    const arr = [1, 2, 3];
    ```

    You can also create an array with `new` constructor and `Array(..)` function. For example:

    ```js
    const arr1 = new Array();
    const arr2 = new Array(1, 2, 3);

    console.log(arr1); // []
    console.log(arr2); // [ 1, 2, 3 ]
    ```

    Now if you just pass one argument to the `Array(..)` function, it will create an empty array with the fixed size (fixed length). For example:

    ```js
    const arr = new Array(5);

    console.log(arr); // [ <5 empty items> ]
    ```

    You can also omit the `new` keyword and you will get the same result. For example:

    ```js
    const arr1 = Array(1, 2, 3);
    const arr2 = Array(5);

    console.log(arr1); // [ 1, 2, 3 ]
    console.log(arr2); // [ <5 empty items> ]
    ```

    Another way that you can create an array is using `Array.of(..)` method. This will be slower from a performance perspective than normal declaration (e.g. `const arr = [1, 2]`). For example:

    ```js
    const arr = Array.of(1, 2);

    console.log(arr); // [ 1, 2 ]
    ```

- The `Array.from(..)` method allows you to convert an iterable or an array-object which isn't an array yet to an array. For example:

    ```js
    const arr1 = Array.from([1, 2, 3]);
    const arr2 = Array.from("Hi!");

    console.log(arr1); // [ 1, 2, 3 ]
    console.log(arr2); // [ 'H', 'i', '!' ]
    ```
