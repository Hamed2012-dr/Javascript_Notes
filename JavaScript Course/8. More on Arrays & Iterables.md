# More on Arrays & Iterables

- An **iterable** is an object that implement the **iterable** protocol and have an **@@iterator** method (`Symbol.iterator`). They are objects where you can use the `for-of` loop. In **JavaScript**, not every iterable is an array. Other iterables are (for example): `NodeList`, `String`, `Map`, `Set`.
- An **array-like object** is a object that have a `length` property and use indexes to access items. In **JavaScript**, not every array-like object is an array. Other array-likes are (for example): `NodeList`, `String`.
