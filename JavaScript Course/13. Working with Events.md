# Working with Events

- You can run your code upon certain events in **JavaScript** with the help of **Event Listeners**.
- Events typically transport data and you will get that data and object that is created for each event automatically as an argument passed into the function you register as an event listener and thus far we always ignored that argument.
- You can set an event to an element with event properties (e.g. `oneclick`, `onchange`, `onblur`, `onabort`, and etc), but the property sets just one event (if you set another one, the new one will overwrite it), so you **can't** add multiple events to an element. For example:

    ```js
    const button = document.getElementById("button");
    const buttonClickHandler = () => {
        console.log("This was clicked!");
    };
    const anotherButtonClickHandler = () => {
        console.log("Clicked");
    };

    button.onclick = buttonClickHandler;
    button.onclick = anotherButtonClickHandler;
    // === User clicked on the button ===
    // Clicked
    ```

    Instead you can use `addEventListener(..)` method to add multiple events to an element. The `removeEventListener(..)` will remove an event from an element easily. For example:

    ```js
    const button = document.getElementById("button");
    const buttonClickHandler = () => {
        console.log("This was clicked!");
    };
    const anotherButtonClickHandler = () => {
        console.log("Clicked");
    };

    button.addEventListener("click", buttonClickHandler);
    button.addEventListener("click", anotherButtonClickHandler);
    // === User clicked on the button ===
    // This was clicked
    // Clicked
    ```

    You can also add an event to a HTML tag as an attribute. It's **not** a good practice. For example:

    ```html
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8" />
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
        <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="ie=edge" />
        <title>Events</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <button onclick="alert('Hi there!');">Click me</button>
    </body>
    </html>
    ```

- You can remove an event listener with `removeEventListener(..)` method. It takes two arguments (first for the event name and second for the registered function). For example:

    ```js
    const button = document.getElementById("button");
    const buttonClickHandler = () => {
        console.log("This was clicked!");
    };

    button.addEventListener("click", buttonClickHandler);
    setTimeout(() => {
        button.removeEventListener("click", buttonClickHandler)
    }, 2000);
    ```

- In **JavaScript**, whatever causes an event typically also provides you some data along with such an event to describe it, to give you some extra meta data or to give you methods to control how the event behaves thereafter. For example:

    ```js
    const button = document.querySelector("button");
    const buttonClickHandler = event => {
        console.log(event);
    };

    button.addEventListener("click", buttonClickHandler);
    // === User clicked on the button ===
    /*
    MouseEvent {isTrusted: true, screenX: 220, screenY: 324, clientX: 220, clientY: 191, …}
       altKey: false
       bubbles: true
       button: 0
       buttons: 0
       cancelBubble: false
       cancelable: true
       clientX: 220
       clientY: 191
       composed: true
       ctrlKey: false
       currentTarget: null
       defaultPrevented: false
       detail: 1
       eventPhase: 0
       fromElement: null
       isTrusted: true
       layerX: 220
       layerY: 191
       metaKey: false
       movementX: 0
       movementY: 0
       offsetX: 90
       offsetY: 41
       pageX: 220
       pageY: 191
    -> path: (6) [button, div, body, html, document, Window]
       relatedTarget: null
       returnValue: true
       screenX: 220
       screenY: 324
       shiftKey: false
    -> sourceCapabilities: InputDeviceCapabilities {firesTouchEvents: false}
    -> srcElement: button
    -> target: button
       timeStamp: 3217.124999995576
    -> toElement: button
       type: "click"
    -> view: Window {parent: Window, opener: null, top: Window, length: 0,   frames: Window, …}
       which: 1
       x: 220
       y: 191
    -> __proto__: MouseEvent
    */
    ```

    Every event has the `target` property and this describes which target (element) in the end caused this event (in this case where you clicked on). For example:

    ```js
    const buttons = document.querySelectorAll("button");
    const buttonClickHandler = event => {
        event.target.disabled = true;
    };

    buttons.forEach(btn => {
        btn.addEventListener("click", buttonClickHandler);
    });
    ```

    Of course you're also not limited to registering events only on buttons, you can register events on any DOM elements, on any HTML element you want to listen. You can also register events on the overall window (e.g. you can listen to scroll events there). Almost all DOM elements support all events, but as always [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) is the place to go if you want to be really sure. For example:

    ```js
    let curElementNumber = 0;

    function scrollHandler() {
        const distanceToBottom = document.body.getBoundingClientRect().bottom;

        if (distanceToBottom < document.documentElement.clientHeight + 150) {
            const newDataElement = document.createElement('div');
            curElementNumber++;
            newDataElement.innerHTML = `<p>Element ${curElementNumber}</p>`;
            document.body.append(newDataElement);
        }
    }

    window.addEventListener('scroll', scrollHandler);
    ```

    It's an example of basic infinite scrolling.
- You might want to prevent the default behavior of the brower (e.g. submit button which sends specific data to the server) sometimes. You can do that by calling `preventDefault()` method which exist on the event object. For example:

    ```js
    const form = document.querySelector("form");

    form.addEventListener("submit", event => {
        event.preventDefault();
    });
    ```

    This method exists on any event object in **JavaScript**, not just for the submit button.
- When an event happens on an element, it first runs the handlers on it, then on its parent, then all the way up on other ancestors. The process is called **bubbling**, because events bubble from the inner element up through parents like a bubble in the water. There’s another phase of event processing called **capturing**. It is rarely used in real code, but sometimes can be useful and it's the opposite of bubbling. You could switch to the capturing phase by adding an extra third argument on the event listeners. For example:

    ```js
    const button = document.querySelector("button");

    button.addEventListener("click", event => {
        console.log(event);
    }, true);
    ```

    If you set this to `true`, you're telling the browser this event listener should be part of the capturing phase (the default value is `false`).
- You can stops the events propagation with `stopPropagation()` method which exist on the event object. It means any other listeners for the same type of event on some ancestor elements will not trigger their event listeners for that event. For example:

    ```js
    const button = document.querySelector("button");

    button.addEventListener("click", event => {
        event.stopPropagation();
    });
    ```

    You have also `stopImmediatePropagation()` method and that is useful if you have multiple event listeners on the same element, then after the first event listener, the other listeners (the other listeners on the same element) also wouldn't run anymore. With `stopPropagation()`, all button event listeners would execute and only ancestor element clicked listeners would not execute.
- Capturing and bubbling allow us to implement one of most powerful event handling patterns called **event delegation**. The idea is that if we have a lot of elements handled in a similar way, then instead of assigning a handler to each of them, we put a single handler on their common ancestor. For example you have a list (`<ul>`) with five list items (`<li>`) and each of them have a paragraph (`<p>`):

    ```js
    const list = document.querySelector("ul");

    list.addEventListener("click", event => {
        event.target.closest("li").classList.toggle("highlight");
    })
    ```

    You can also add an event listener to every list items, but that will be more cumbersome. Additionally it can get bad from a performance and memory perspective, because we got a lot of event listeners out there.
- In **JavaScript**, a lot of events you can listen to, can be triggered programmatically, especially something like clicks or form submissions. For example:

    ```js
    const form = document.querySelector("form");
    const list = document.querySelector("ul");

    list.addEventListener("click", event => {
        event.target.classList.toggle("highlight");
        form.submit();
    });
    ```

    The `submit()` method fires when a form is about to be submitted. If you trigger a submit event programmatically, then indeed the submit event listener is skipped (typically event listeners execute). So triggering such an event programmatically is not exactly the same as when a user clicks on it, it can bypass certain listeners like a form submission listener.
- In **JavaScript**, by default with a normal function, `this` inside of a function which you assign to an event listener points at the current target of the event. For example:

    ```js
    const list = document.querySelector("ul");

    list.addEventListener("click", function (event) {
        console.log(this);
    });
    // === User clicked on the button ===
    // <ul>...</ul>
    ```
