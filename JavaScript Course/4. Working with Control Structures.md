# 4. Working with Control Structures (if Statements, Loops, Error Handling)

- `if` statement is a core construct, not just in **JavaScript**, but actually in any programming language you can learn.
- The double sign equal operator (`==`) is used to compare two values and then return `true` or `false` and you use it to check for value equality. For example: `a == b`.
- The `!=` operator checks for value inequality. For example: `a == b`.
- The `===` operator checks the value equality with strict (check for value and type). It forces you to write better code For example: `a === b`.
- The `!==` operator checks the value inequality with strict (check for value and type). For example: `a !== b`.
- The two `<` and `>` operators checks for value being greater/smaller. For example: `a < b` or `a > b`.
- The two `<=` and `>=` operators checks for value being greater or equal/smaller or equal. For example: `a <= b` or `a >= b`.
- The `!` operator will negates a boolean. For example:

    ```js
    let bool = true;

    if (!bool) { // is bool a falsy value?!
        console.log("Won't get here");
    }
    ```

- Always keep in mind that condition in `if (condition) {..}` simply has to be a **boolean** value. Often, you'll generate such a boolean value with the help of `===`, `<`, `>`, and etc. All these operators yield boolean vlaues (without changing the variables/values you're using them on). Since if only wants a boolean, you of course don't have to use such an operator. If you already got a variable that holds a boolean, you can use it without any extra operator. For example:

    ```js
    const isLoggedIn = true;

    if (isLoggedIn) {
        // This code will execute because isLoggedIn is true => A valid condition
    }
    ```

    You could write:

    ```js
    const isLoggedIn = true;

    if (isLoggedIn === true) {
        // ..
    }
    ```

    But that would be redundant. you'd generate another new boolean where you already got one.
- Strings can also be compared with greater than (`>`) or lower/smaller than (`<`) operators.
- **JavaScript** compares strings based on standard lexicographical ordering, using Unicode values. For example `b` is greater than `a`. **JavaScript** always looks at the first character and only considers other characters if the first character is similar. In addition, capital characters are considered to be smaller than lowercase characters. For example:

    ```js
    "ab" > "aa"; // true
    "ab" > "B"; // true
    "a" > "b"; // false
    ```

- You can make a conditional chain in **JavaScript** (also in other languages) by using `else if` and `else` keywords. For example:

    ```js
    const num = 15;

    if (isLoggedIn === 10) {
        // Won't execute here
    }
    else if (isLoggedIn === 20) {
        // Won't execute here
    }
    else {
        // Will execute here
    }
    ```

- If you compare two objects with the same value (no mather if you use `==` or `===` operator) in **JavaScript**, it will return `false`. Objects and arrays are kind of special in **JavaScript**. For example:

    ```js
    let obj1 = { name: "Hamed" };
    let obj2 = { name: "Hamed" };

    if (obj1 === obj2) { // false
        // Won't get here
    }
    ```

    But you can compare objects property values. For example:

    ```js
    let obj1 = { name: "Hamed" };
    let obj2 = { name: "Hamed" };

    if (obj1.name == obj1.name) { // true
        // Will get here
    }
    ```

    If you store an object in a variable (or a constant), then you compare it to its reference, it will return `true`. For example:

    ```js
    let obj1 = { name: "Hamed" };
    let obj2 = obj1;

    if (obj1 === obj2) { //true
        // Will get here
    }
    ```

- In **JavaScript** you can have logical conditions. The `&&` logical operator will return `true` if both operand are true. The `||` logical operator will return `true` of any of two operand is `true`. For example:

    ```js
    let name = "Hamed";
    let age = 23;

    if (name === "Ali" && age === 23) { // false
        // Won't get here
    }
    else if (name === "Hamed" || age === 250) { // true
        // Will get here
    }
    ```

- You can use plain `return` keyword for exit the function from execution. For example:

    ```js
    if (
        calculationType !== "ADD" &&
        calculationType !== "SUBTRACT" &&
        calculationType !== "MULTIPLY" &&
        calculationType !== "DIVIDE"
    ) {
        return;
    }
    ```

- The operator precedence in **JavaScript** is like normal mathematic precedence. Consider:

    ```js
    3 + 2 > 9 - 2
    ```

    This is like `(3 + 2) > (9 - 2)`. You can see the operator precedence table in MDN website ([click here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Operator_Precedence)).
