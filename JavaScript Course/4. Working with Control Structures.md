# 4. Working with Control Structures (if Statements, Loops, Error Handling)

- `if` statement is a core construct, not just in **JavaScript**, but actually in any programming language you can learn.
- The double sign equal operator (`==`) is used to compare two values and then return `true` or `false` and you use it to check for value equality. For example: `a == b`.
- The `!=` operator checks for value inequality. For example: `a == b`.
- The `===` operator checks the value equality with strict (check for value and type). It forces you to write better code For example: `a === b`.
- The `!==` operator checks the value inequality with strict (check for value and type). For example: `a !== b`.
- The two `<` and `>` operators checks for value being greater/smaller. For example: `a < b` or `a > b`.
- The two `<=` and `>=` operators checks for value being greater or equal/smaller or equal. For example: `a <= b` or `a >= b`.
- The `!` operator will negates a boolean. For example:

    ```js
    let bool = true;

    if (!bool) { // is bool a falsy value?!
        console.log("Won't get here");
    }
    ```
