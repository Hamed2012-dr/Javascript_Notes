# 4. Working with Control Structures (if Statements, Loops, Error Handling)

- `if` statement is a core construct, not just in **JavaScript**, but actually in any programming language you can learn.
- The double sign equal operator (`==`) is used to compare two values and then return `true` or `false` and you use it to check for value equality. For example: `a == b`.
- The `!=` operator checks for value inequality. For example: `a == b`.
- The `===` operator checks the value equality with strict (check for value and type). It forces you to write better code For example: `a === b`.
- The `!==` operator checks the value inequality with strict (check for value and type). For example: `a !== b`.
- The two `<` and `>` operators checks for value being greater/smaller. For example: `a < b` or `a > b`.
- The two `<=` and `>=` operators checks for value being greater or equal/smaller or equal. For example: `a <= b` or `a >= b`.
- The `!` operator will negates a boolean. For example:

    ```js
    let bool = true;

    if (!bool) { // is bool a falsy value?!
        console.log("Won't get here");
    }
    ```

- Always keep in mind that condition in `if (condition) {..}` simply has to be a **boolean** value. Often, you'll generate such a boolean value with the help of `===`, `<`, `>`, and etc. All these operators yield boolean vlaues (without changing the variables/values you're using them on). Since if only wants a boolean, you of course don't have to use such an operator. If you already got a variable that holds a boolean, you can use it without any extra operator. For example:

    ```js
    const isLoggedIn = true;

    if (isLoggedIn) {
        // This code will execute because isLoggedIn is true => A valid condition
    }
    ```

    You could write:

    ```js
    const isLoggedIn = true;

    if (isLoggedIn === true) {
        // ..
    }
    ```

    But that would be redundant. you'd generate another new boolean where you already got one.
- Strings can also be compared with greater than (`>`) or lower/smaller than (`<`) operators.
- **JavaScript** compares strings based on standard lexicographical ordering, using Unicode values. For example `b` is greater than `a`. **JavaScript** always looks at the first character and only considers other characters if the first character is similar. In addition, capital characters are considered to be smaller than lowercase characters. For example:

    ```js
    "ab" > "aa"; // true
    "ab" > "B"; // true
    "a" > "b"; // false
    ```

- You can make a conditional chain in **JavaScript** (also in other languages) by using `else if` and `else` keywords. For example:

    ```js
    const num = 15;

    if (isLoggedIn === 10) {
        // Won't execute here
    }
    else if (isLoggedIn === 20) {
        // Won't execute here
    }
    else {
        // Will execute here
    }
    ```

- If you compare two objects with the same value (no mather if you use `==` or `===` operator) in **JavaScript**, it will return `false`. Objects and arrays are kind of special in **JavaScript**. For example:

    ```js
    let obj1 = { name: "Hamed" };
    let obj2 = { name: "Hamed" };

    if (obj1 === obj2) { // false
        // Won't get here
    }
    ```

    But you can compare objects property values. For example:

    ```js
    let obj1 = { name: "Hamed" };
    let obj2 = { name: "Hamed" };

    if (obj1.name == obj1.name) { // true
        // Will get here
    }
    ```

    If you store an object in a variable (or a constant), then you compare it to its reference, it will return `true`. For example:

    ```js
    let obj1 = { name: "Hamed" };
    let obj2 = obj1;

    if (obj1 === obj2) { //true
        // Will get here
    }
    ```

- In **JavaScript** you can have logical conditions. The `&&` logical operator will return `true` if both operand are true. The `||` logical operator will return `true` of any of two operand is `true`. For example:

    ```js
    let name = "Hamed";
    let age = 23;

    if (name === "Ali" && age === 23) { // false
        // Won't get here
    }
    else if (name === "Hamed" || age === 250) { // true
        // Will get here
    }
    ```

- You can use plain `return` keyword for exit the function from execution. For example:

    ```js
    if (
        calculationType !== "ADD" &&
        calculationType !== "SUBTRACT" &&
        calculationType !== "MULTIPLY" &&
        calculationType !== "DIVIDE"
    ) {
        return;
    }
    ```

- The operator precedence in **JavaScript** is like normal mathematic precedence. Consider:

    ```js
    3 + 2 > 9 - 2
    ```

    This is like `(3 + 2) > (9 - 2)`. You can see the operator precedence table in MDN website ([click here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Operator_Precedence)).
- `0` in **JavaScript** is treated as a **falsy** value and any other number (inc. negative numbers) are treated as **truthy** values.
- `""` (empty string) in **JavaScript** is treated as a **falsy** value and any other non-empty strings (inc. `"false"`) are treated as **truthy** values.
- `{}`, `[]` and all other objects and arrays in **JavaScript** are treated as **truthy** values.
- `null`, `undefined`, and `NaN` are always treated as **falsy** values.
- If you want to define a hard-coded constant, it's better to define its name with all capital letters and underline (`_`) separator (it's usually `number`s and `string`s). For example:

    ```js
    let ATTACK_VALUE = 10;
    ```

- You can use `prompt(..)` built-in function that shows a dialog where the user may enter something. This will return the user input. For example:

    ```js
    let name = prompt("What's your name?"); // user entered: Hamed

    console.log(name); // Hamed
    ```

    `prompt(..)` have a second optional parameter that takes a `string` for its default value. For example:

    ```js
    let name = propmt("What's your name?", "Hamed"); // user entered nothing

    console.log(name); // Hamed
    ```

- It's better to always make a variable then use it instead of entering a literal value.
- You can't assign an if statement to a variable, because this will not return anything. This will actually be a syntax error therefore. This is not allowed. You can use **ternary operator** for this sake. Consider:

    ```js
    const userName = isLogin ? "Hamed" : null;
    ```

    You first put your condition which you want to check and there you can have any condition, you could have an `if` statement, including multiple conditions combined with `&&` and `||`. Then you have the question (`?`) mark and thereafter you have the value you want to use is the condition is `true`. Then you have a colon (`:`) and you have your `else` value and you need to specify this. So omitting that `else` is not allowed, that would be a syntax error as well.
- In **JavaScript**, an **expression** is something that yields a value you could store in a constant or a variable or `return` in a function, something like this, that's expression. So you could memorize that an expression is  basically something which would work if you use it on the right side of an equal sign. That's difference between **statements** and **expressions**.
- You can convert (or coerce) a truthy or falsy value to a real boolean. You so this with the double exclamation mark (`!!`), also called double bang operator. For example:

    ```js
    console.log(!!""); // false
    console.log(!!1); // true
    ```

- You can use `||` operator for assigning default values. Consider:

    ```js
    const someInput = false;
    const name = someInput || "Hamed";

    console.log(name); // Hamed
    ```

    If `someInput` is exist or is a truthy value, it will be returned. Otherwise `"Hamed"` will be returned. You can use `&&` operator like this, but it works the other way around:

    ```js
    let isLoggedIn = true;
    const shoppingCart = isLoggedIn && ["Books"];

    console.log(shoppingCart); // ["Hamed"]
    isLoggedIn = false;
    console.log(isLoggedIn && ["Books"]); // false
    ```

- You can use `switch` statement in your program, instead of using many `if` statements. `switch` takes an expression that yields a value. You can check that value with `case` keyword. Behind the scence, `switch` always use the triple sign (`===`) operator to compare. Then a colon (`:`) needed for that `case`s statements. You should break the `switch` with `break` keyword after the `case`s. Otherwise, it will fall though the `case`s and executes them. You can use `default` if no cases met. `default` is optional, and it doesn't need the `break`. For example:

    ```js
    let name = "Hamed";

    switch (name) {
        case "Ali":
            console.log("Won't get here");
            break;
        case "Reza":
            console.log("Won't get here");
            break;
        case "Mehrdad":
            console.log("Won't get here");
            break;
        case "Hamid":
        case "Hamed":
            console.log("Will get here");
            break;
        default:
            console.log("Not found!");
    }
    ```

- In **JavaScript** you can execute code multiple times with `for` loops. There are four kind of loops in **JavaScript**:
  - `for`: Execute code a certain amount of times (with counter variable). For example:

    ```js
    // `i` stands for iterator
    for (let i = 0, i < 3; i++) {
        console.log(i);
    }
    ```

  - `for-of`: Execute for every element in an array. For example:

    ```js
    for (const el of array) {
        console.log(el);
    }
    ```

  - `for-in`: Executes for every key in an object. For example:

    ```js
    for (const key in obj) {
        console.log(key);
        console.log(obj[key]);
    }
    ```

  - `while`: Execute code as long as condition is `true`. For example:

    ```js
    while (isLoggedIn) {
        // ..
    }
    ```

- You can get length of an array or an object with `length` property.
- You can omit the increment in `for` loops and do it manually. For example:

    ```js
    for (let i = 0; i < 10;) {
        i++;
        console.log(i);
    }
    ```

- Behind the scene, the `for-of` loop creates a constant for every iteration. That why we can use `const` there. For example:

    ```js
    for (const ev of events) {
        ev.fire();
    }
    ```

- The `for-of` only works with arrays. So you can't use it for `object`s, `number`s, and `boolean`s. This work with `string`s, because a `string` is a kind of array. For example:

    ```js
    const name = "Hamed";

    for (const str of name) {
        console.log(str);
    }
    // H
    // a
    // m
    // e
    // d
    ```

- You can check the condition for the `while` loop after its body execution with `do` keyword. It means the body will execute at least one time. For example:

    ```js
    let isLoggedIn = false;

    do {
        console.log("Will get there");
    } while (isLoggedIn);
    ```

- You can exit from the `loop` execution with `break` keyword. For example:

    ```js
    for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        if (i >= 4) {
            break;
        }
        console.log(i);
    }
    // 0
    // 1
    // 2
    // 3
    ```

- You can skip the loop iteration with `continue` keyword. Its like the `break`, but `break` will exit the execution. In some cases you need to skip execution in the loops. For example:

    ```js
    for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        if (i === 3) {
            continue;
        }
        console.log(i);
    }
    // 0
    // 1
    // 2
    // 4
    ```

- You can `break` the outer loop in **JavaScript** with labeled loops. Consider:

    ```js
    let j = 0;

    outerWhile: do {
        console.log("Outer", j);
        innerFor: for (let k = 0; k < 5; k++) {
            if (k === 3) {
                break outerWhile;
            }
            console.log("Inner", k);
        }
        i++;
    } while (j < 3);
    ```

    Here we break both inner `for` loop and outer `while` loop using label. It's rarely used. You can also use it for `continue`.
- In **JavaScript** some errors can't be avoided (beyond your control as a developer). For example user input errors (e.g. user enters text like `"hi"` instead of a number) or network errors (e.g. server is offline). You can throw your own error (with `throw ..`) and catch it for handling these kind of errors. You can do that with `try {..} catch (error) {..}`. For example:

    ```js
    function getMaxLifeValues() {
        const enteredValue = prompt("What's your name?", "Hamed");
        const parsedValue = parseInt(enteredValue);
        if (isNaN(parsedValue) || parsedValue <= 0) {
            throw { message: "Invalid user input, not a number!" };
        }
        return parsedValue;
    }

    let chosenMaxLife;

    try {
        chosenMaxLife = getMaxLifeValues();
    } catch (error) {
        console.log(error); // {message: "Invalid user input, not a number!"}
        chosenMaxLife = 100;
    }
    ```

- Don't wrap your entire script into `try` block, it's not good for **performance** and it's also a very bad programming style.
- There is another keyword for `try {..} catch (error) {..}` for cleanup purpose. That's `finally {..}` block. This block will always execute, no matter if you had an error or not. For example:

    ```js
    try {
        throw "Oops";
    } catch (error) {
        console.log(error);
    } finally {
        console.log("Cleanup");
    }
    // Oops
    // Cleanup
    ```
