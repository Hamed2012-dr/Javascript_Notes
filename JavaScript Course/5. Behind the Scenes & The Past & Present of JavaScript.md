# Behind the Scenes & The (Weird) Past (ES3, ES5) & Present (ES6+) of JavaScript

- ES stands for **E**CMA**S**cript. Over time, ECMAScript and therefore **JavaScript** evolved, it dates back into the 90s of course when it got started.
- ES6 was a major mark in development of **JavaScript**. Many new features added that help us to write cleaner, better, and faster code. **JavaScript** is still under active development, but ES6 was a big step step forward.
- All the modern browsers (includes Edge) have an auto updating functionality which means people don't have to manually install new browser versions, which was the case with older versions of Internet Explorer and therefor features can be integrated into browsers at a much faster pace and more and more users will automatically use these latest versions of browsers, because the browsers themselves automatically update, so that's really cool.
