## Preface

- The evolutionary changes to the language introduced in the **ECMAScript 2015 Language Specification**.
- ES6 is a radical jump forward for the language.

## Versioning

- The ill-fated ES4 never came about.
- In 2009, ES5 was officially finalized (later ES5.1 in 2011), and settled as the widespread standard for **JavaScript** for the modern revolution and explosion of browsers, such as **Firefox**, **Chrome**, **Opera**, **Safari**, and many others.
